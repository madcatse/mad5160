Here are the GAL16V8 JEDEC, EQN and LOG files for anyone who wants to duplicate this. Since you'll be putting a 20-pin DIP iinto a 16-pin socket, you'll need to connect pins 8 and 10 (it's okay to include pin 9 if that makes the job easier) on the 20 pin DIP or, if you use a stacked socket, the socket. Just plug the GAL in so that pin 1 on the GAL matches pin 1 of U44 on the 5160 planar. Stick in 4 banks of 41256s and you're good to go.
