2024-06-10 14:25:46 13408  [WARNING] Warning: Power / ground nets are not included in selection. To analyze a power / ground net, use the power-integrity features on the Simulate PI or Export > Model menus.
2024-06-10 14:26:48 13408     [INFO] This design's .HYP file was created by a PCB translator that did not record whether the physical information is sufficiently detailed for power-integrity analysis (especially metal areas and via clearances).  Most likely, the translator was an older version not upgraded for PI usage.  PI simulation may therefore produce less-accurate results.
